# hello-world
This is my first repository.
My name is Thethree13, and I am a beginner programmer. I usually use Scratch or Python.

I made this becuase I wanted to expand my coding world (also becuase a game required me to clone a repo)
Sooner or later I will require a github account anyway, so I thought why not start now?
